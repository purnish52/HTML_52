        As we mentioned, some people think that this place was either a religious center or the summer resort of Pachacutec. In any case, this enormous and incredible place was designed with extreme attention to the details. It was a special place to be in the Incas times. It’s also like that now. On the other hand, as we also mentioned, this citadel was made on the top of a mountain. This makes the construction even more impressive. They needed to go all the way up with the construction materials, which were enormous stone blocks. They had also to secure the supply of enough food and water as it’s believed that the priest, the virgins, and the Inca spent their time there.<br>
